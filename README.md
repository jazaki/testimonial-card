## Project brief
In this challenge, you will develop a card featuring a user testimonial, including a profile image, name, username, and the testimonial body.

## Implementation requirements
- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Handle long strings**: In reality, the person's name and testimonial can be extremely long. The UI should be able to accommodate extremely long strings by either wrapping to the next line, truncating, or both.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper alt tags for images.
